## Introduction

Hangman is a simple yet fun game where you need to guess the hidden word one letter at a time. Each incorrect guess brings you closer to losing the game, so choose wisely!

## Features

- Random word selection from a predefined list.
- Input validation to ensure valid guesses.
- Display of the current state of the word with underscores for unguessed letters.
- Win/loss conditions based on the number of incorrect guesses.

## Installation

To run this Hangman game on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

2. Ensure you have Python installed (version 3.6 or higher recommended).

3. Run the game:

    ```

## How to Play

1. Run the game script.
2. A random word will be selected, and you will see underscores representing each letter of the word.
3. Guess one letter at a time by typing it and pressing Enter.
4. If the letter is in the word, it will be revealed in the correct positions.
5. If the letter is not in the word, you will lose one guess.
6. You win if you guess all the letters in the word correctly before running out of guesses.
7. You lose if you run out of guesses before completing the word.
